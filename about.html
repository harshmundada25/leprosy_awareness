            <h2>What is Leprosy?</h2>
            <p>Leprosy, also known as Hansen’s disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by <em>Mycobacterium leprae</em>. It primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucous membranes, and eyes. The disease progresses slowly, and early detection is crucial to prevent severe complications.</p>
            <p><b>Fact:</b> Leprosy has been known for over 4,000 years and was historically feared due to a lack of understanding. Today, it is fully curable with <b>multi-drug therapy (MDT)</b>.</p>

            <h2>Anandwan: A Haven for Leprosy Patients</h2>
            <p>Founded by <b>Baba Amte</b> in 1948, Anandwan is a self-sustaining community in Warora, Maharashtra. It provides rehabilitation, medical care, and vocational training to people affected by leprosy and other disabilities.</p>
            <p>Anandwan promotes <b>dignity, self-reliance, and empowerment</b> by transforming lives through education, skill development, and community support.</p>

            <h2>How Does Leprosy Spread?</h2>
            <p>Leprosy spreads through <b>prolonged close contact</b> with an untreated person, mainly via respiratory droplets. However, <b>it is not highly contagious</b>. Most people have natural immunity, and early treatment prevents further transmission.</p>

            <h2>Symptoms of Leprosy</h2>
            <p>Symptoms appear gradually and can take years to develop. Common signs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Discolored patches of skin with loss of sensation.</li>
                <li>Numbness or tingling in the hands and feet.</li>
                <li>Muscle weakness, paralysis, or deformities in advanced cases.</li>
                <li>Eye problems that can lead to blindness.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Without treatment, <b>leprosy can cause permanent nerve damage and disabilities</b>.</p>

            <h2>Leprosy in Numbers</h2>
            <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Over <b>200,000 new cases</b> of leprosy are detected worldwide every year.</li>
                <li>More than <b>3 million people</b> live with disabilities caused by leprosy.</li>
                <li>India, Brazil, and Indonesia account for <b>nearly 80%</b> of new cases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Leprosy still exists, but with awareness and timely treatment, it can be eliminated.</p>

            <h2>Treatment and Cure</h2>
            <p>Leprosy is <b>completely curable</b> with <b>multi-drug therapy (MDT)</b>, which is provided <b>free of cost</b> by the WHO.</p>
            <p>MDT consists of a combination of <b>Rifampicin, Clofazimine, and Dapsone</b>, taken for 6 to 12 months depending on the severity.</p>
            <p>Early diagnosis and treatment can <b>prevent disabilities</b> and ensure a normal life.</p>

        <div class="text-box fade-in">
            <h2>Breaking the Stigma</h2>
            <p>Despite being curable, leprosy is still associated with discrimination and social exclusion. Many patients suffer from <b>psychological distress</b> due to stigma.</p>
            <p><b>Anandwan is a living example</b> of how acceptance and support can help leprosy patients lead fulfilling lives.</p>
            <p>Raising awareness and spreading knowledge helps <b>eliminate fear and myths</b> surrounding the disease.</p>
